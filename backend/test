It&rsquo;s the lone ship in the area, so the crew must operate without access to further support. Coriolanus IV is a mining colony that recently discovered one of the largest deposits of dilithium ever recorded, so it is critical to discover what happened and protect the deposits.&#10;&#10;"

Modiphius is also sculpting an accompanying Star Trek miniature figure line, the first to be produced in seventeen years. Resin and metal 32mm-scale hobby figures will feature classic Star Trek characters and crews, boarding parties, and away teams. Geomorphic tile maps of burning Federation ships, mysterious colonies and embattled Klingon cruisers will set the scene for dramatic new voyages in the Final Frontier.&#10; Under license by CBS Consumer Products, Star Trek Adventures is slated for a mid-2017 release and the playtest crews will be listed in the Star Trek Adventures book manifest.&#10;&#10;"
