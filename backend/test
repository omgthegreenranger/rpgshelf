  "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Star Trek Adventures uses the Modiphius 2d20 game system (Mutant Chronicles, Infinity, Conan, John Carter of Mars) designed by Jay Little (Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, X-Wing Miniatures Game). Modiphius is also sculpting an accompanying Star Trek miniature figure line, the first to be produced in seventeen years. Resin and metal 32mm-scale hobby figures will feature classic Star Trek characters and crews, boarding parties, and away teams. Geomorphic tile maps of burning Federation ships, mysterious colonies and embattled Klingon cruisers will set the scene for dramatic new voyages in the Final Frontier.&#10; Under license by CBS Consumer Products, Star Trek Adventures is slated for a mid-2017 release and the playtest crews will be listed in the Star Trek Adventures book manifest.&#10;&#10;"
