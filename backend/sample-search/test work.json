That&rsquo;s why, when a mysterious alien is discovered that claims to come from a place no one in the Alpha/Beta Quadrants has gone before, Starfleet makes it a top priority to send a ship in that direction. It is a mission of exploration as well as one of mercy, for the alien wishes to return home. Starfleet is all but happy to oblige.&#10;&#10;Hello again! I&rsquo;m excited for the opportunity to bring you the third of my STA Mission Compendiums. Like the first two, this compendium has four full-length missions inside complete with everything you&rsquo;ll need to run the adventures at your own table. The missions are designed to be played in linear fashion, though not necessarily back to back. They should provide at least 3 to 4 hours of gameplay for the average group of GM and players.&#10;&#10;This particular set of missions has been designed specifically around a unique alien, Andromeda, in the year 2381 and beyond. They were initially written and run for the Adiona group which I was the Gamemaster (GM) for. It is my hope that by providing these missions to you that you and your group will have just as much fun as ours did. That said, the contents within can be easily adapted to suit other ships/campaigns/characters to suit your needs!&#10;&#10;"

This is a fringe Federation sector near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The sector had been previously conquered by the Dominion and later liberated by Reman commando squads whose actions caused the citizens they were liberating to mistrust them further. As such, there is some resistance in the sector to accepting Romulan refugees, and when evidence of unexpected ship movements comes to light, the local governor demands you investigate.&#10;&#10;When the investigation uncovers the truth of those ship movements, you and your crew may find yourselves caught between opposing factions with conflicting responsibilities to resolve. Will it be possible to negotiate a compromise? If not, which side should you favor in order to do the least harm?&#10;&#10;Although this is a standalone adventure, a bonus one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission.&#10;&#10;This 24-page PDF adventure for the Star Trek Adventures roleplaying game is written by Christopher L. Bennett, and is set post-2385 in the Star Trek: Picard era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in other Star Trek time periods.&#10;&#10;"

Bonaventure. They are tasked with overseeing the Bonaventure&rsquo;s launch and subsequent shakedown cruise. Come the end of the shakedown, an Alliance Fleet attempts to capture or destroy the Bonaventure. It&rsquo;s up to the Player Characters to ensure the Terran Empire&rsquo;s new flagship does not fall!&#10;    Mirror of Steel: Tau Ceti has always been a stain on the Terran Empire&rsquo;s history. The system is still being held by the Rebellion, something that the Empress herself cannot abide. The Player Characters are tasked with capturing the system and ensuring that all signs of rebellion are quashed.&#10;    Crystal Mirror: Strange Signals are coming from a nearby &ldquo;Star Desert&rdquo; where there is supposed to be space with zero density and no change in gravimetric readings. When the Player Characters investigate, they find that a Tholian Spinner-class has somehow managed to cross over from the Prime Universe. Capturing and studying this vessel would lead to great technological advancements. Yet neither the Tholians, nor the Rebellion ships cloaked nearby, are going to make it easy for the Player Characters! &#10;    Broken Mirror: In their return to their ship after an away mission, the Player Characters find themselves transported to the Prime Universe aboard a DY-100-class sleeper ship full of Augments. They must find their way back home or be forced to start over in a Universe that would see them confined or destroyed!&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Successful first contacts may result in the growth of the Federation, while a failed first contact could result in the creation of a new adversary.&#10;&#10;This packet presents ten detailed mission briefs oriented around first contacts, each of which you can modify for use in your Star Trek Adventures campaigns set during the original series era (approximately 2250&ndash;2299) or any other era of play with minor modifications. Each mission brief is designed to stand alone, though they could easily be strung together into a story arc or added to an existing campaign.&#10;&#10;"

Modiphius is also sculpting an accompanying Star Trek miniature figure line, the first to be produced in seventeen years. Resin and metal 32mm-scale hobby figures will feature classic Star Trek characters and crews, boarding parties, and away teams. Geomorphic tile maps of burning Federation ships, mysterious colonies and embattled Klingon cruisers will set the scene for dramatic new voyages in the Final Frontier.&#10; Under license by CBS Consumer Products, Star Trek Adventures is slated for a mid-2017 release and the playtest crews will be listed in the Star Trek Adventures book manifest.&#10;&#10;"
