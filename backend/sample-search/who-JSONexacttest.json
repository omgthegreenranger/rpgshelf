  "description": "From publisher blurb:&#10;&#10;Celebrating the 50th anniversary year of Doctor Who, this Sourcebook explores the Fifth Doctor&rsquo;s adventures on Earth and beyond. With detailed information on all the allies, enemies, aliens and gadgets that he encounters, as well as examining each of his adventures, the book contains a wealth of material for the Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space RPG, and is also a fact-packed resource for fans of the show!&#10;&#10;Betrayed by the Master and left to die on Logopolis, the Doctor faced his most difficult regeneration yet &ndash; but it&rsquo;d be nothing compared to the heartbreak, betrayal and loss that was to come. Fly Concorde through time, re-enact the English civil war, play in a ripping game of cricket and race yachts around the Solar System for the greatest prize of all. Witness the return of some of the universe&rsquo;s greatest foes, restored and deadlier than ever, and thwart their machinations once more &hellip; but at a cost.&#10;&#10;Brave heart, my friends&hellip;&#10;&#10;",
