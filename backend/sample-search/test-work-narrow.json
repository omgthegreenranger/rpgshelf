This is a fringe Federation sector near the Romulan Neutral Zone. The sector had been previously conquered by the Dominion and later liberated by Reman commando squads whose actions caused the citizens they were liberating to mistrust them further. As such, there is some resistance in the sector to accepting Romulan refugees, and when evidence of unexpected ship movements comes to light, the local governor demands you investigate.&#10;&#10;When the investigation uncovers the truth of those ship movements, you and your crew may find yourselves caught between opposing factions with conflicting responsibilities to resolve. Will it be possible to negotiate a compromise? If not, which side should you favor in order to do the least harm?&#10;&#10;Although this is a standalone adventure, a bonus one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission.&#10;&#10;This 24-page PDF adventure for the Star Trek Adventures roleplaying game is written by Christopher L. Bennett, and is set post-2385 in the Star Trek: Picard era with the player characters being the crew of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in other Star Trek time periods.&#10;&#10;", "yearpublished": {"@value": "2023"}, "seriescode": {"@value": ""}}, {"@type": "rpgitem", "@id": "422784", "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sjwrkWEIuwxp_qJhiigSmw__thumb/img/Y76picbrUYKEUbLHAowEz99kKjE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8254334.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sjwrkWEIuwxp_qJhiigSmw__original/img/M-7VCp4WB2ViWropqtZ9mtLb9WA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8254334.jpg", "name": {"@type": "primary", "@sortindex": "1", "@value": "Cold War"}, "link": [{"@type": "rpg", "@id": "37049", "@value": "Star Trek Adventures"}, {"@type": "rpggenre", "@id": "162", "@value": "Science Fiction (Space Opera)"}, {"@type": "rpgsetting", "@id": "2274", "@value": "Star Trek Universe"}, {"@type": "rpgseries", "@id": "74804", "@value": "Mission Briefs"}, {"@type": "rpgcategory", "@id": "2084", "@value": "Scenario / Adventure / Module"}, {"@type": "rpgmechanic", "@id": "2101", "@value": "Attribute/Stat Based (STR, CON, PER, etc)"}, {"@type": "rpgmechanic", "@id": "2088", "@value": "Dice (Primarily d20)"}, {"@type": "rpgmechanic", "@id": "2124", "@value": "Lifepath Character Generation (Character starts at birth)"}, {"@type": "rpgmechanic", "@id": "2138", "@value": "Progression Tree (Skills, professions, magic abilities, etc.)"}, {"@type": "rpgmechanic", "@id": "2094", "@value": "Skill Based (buy or gain skills)"}, {"@type": "rpgpublisher", "@id": "22226", "@value": "Modiphius Entertainment"}, {"@type": "rpgdesigner", "@id": "13571", "@value": "Gareth-Michael Skarka"}, {"@type": "rpgartist", "@id": "39953", "@value": "Michal E.

Ships and crews were often pushed to their limits while attempting any number of missions, from exploring new worlds, encountering new civilizations, or endeavoring to avoid sparking off a war.&#10;&#10;This packet presents ten detailed mission briefs focused on situations late 23rd century Starfleet crews might become involved in. Feel free to modify them for use in your Star Trek Adventures campaigns set during the later period of the original series era (approximately 2270-2300) or any other era of play with minor modifications. Each mission brief is designed to stand alone, though they could easily be strung together into a story arc or added to an existing campaign.&#10;&#10;", "yearpublished": {"@value": "2024"}, "seriescode": {"@value": "Mission Briefs 014"}}]
